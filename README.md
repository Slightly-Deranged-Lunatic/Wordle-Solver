# wordle-solver
A program written in Python to solve Wordle's when given the yellow, green, and colorless letters.

Disclaimers
---
Due to there being no official words list for Wordle that I could get, this program has a low chance to simply not have the word in the dictionary, however, this chance is rather slim, as the words list has 14,000 words

This code was written by a novice, however, I am quite proud of what I have wrote given my knowledge

This repo is currently not accepting any contributions, sorry!
